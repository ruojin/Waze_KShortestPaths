# Waze_KShortestPaths
## Summary
This project is an interactive web application that displays California Road Network on a map that supports two types of queries, finding adjacent edges of certain intersection point and finding the three shortest paths between two intersection points.
## Implementation
For the backend, I use Dijkstra's and Yen's algorthims to find the three shortest paths.
